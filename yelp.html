                            <h2>Introduction</h2>
                            <p>Yelp’s goal is to connect people with local businesses, and are currently able to achieve this 
                                by providing a platform for past customers to share their opinions about said businesses - good or bad - 
                                in hope of helping future customers with the decision of ultimately supporting the establishment or not. 
                                The problem with Yelp currently is that the information provided by past customers is not structured enough 
                                to make it easy to make a quick decision, specifically for menu items. This especially impacts users who are 
                                on-the-go and do not have time to research restaurants or shops for an extended period of time. This also 
                                impacts users who make their decision solely based on the food items offered at the establishment. </p>
                            <h2>Objectives</h2>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Provide Yelpers with information about the menu in an easily digestible format, such as a ranked list. 
                                    The product should limit the need to go through hundreds of pictures or reviews in search for the best items to try on the menu</li>
                                <li>Increase engagement on Yelp restaurant business pages by offering a voting method that does not require writing any words. </li>
                            </ul>
                        </div>

                            <h2>User Research</h2>
                            <p>A series of open-ended questions was initially asked to 10 people on separate occasions to determine the intended 
                                market of the product and gain an understanding of how users currently use Yelp to decide which restaurant to eat at.
                            </p>

                            <ul>
                                <li>There are two main factors users consider when deciding a place to eat at: Average star review (3.5+) and the type of food offered by the establishment</li>
                                <li>There are three common methods users utilize when researching an establishment's menu offerings:</li>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Pictures of the menu</li>
                                    <li>In-built menu (sourced through third-party like Grubhub)</li>
                                    <li>Written reviews</li>
                                </ul>

                            <h4 style="text-align: center">From the user research, it is clear that there is a need for a way to highlight the best parts of the menu in a format that is quick and easy to view. </h4>

                                    The ranking is based on the number of upvotes for each menu item, which is displayed to the right of the list. 
                                    </li>
                                <li>Sarah is intrigued by the 2nd and 3rd item on the ranked list, and decides to order those items from the establishment.</li>

                            <p>The following outlines our promotional strategy once we are closer to our launch date.</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Beta Launch: Start by releasing the product to Yelp Elite Members (very active members on Yelp who get invited to exclusive 
                                    events by posting reviews and pictures). From there, if the response is positive, Yelp can then release the Beta version to a 
                                    small portion of users in high volume regions for general population testing.</li>
                                <li>Once we are about 2 weeks away from our release date, ask Yelp Elite Members to promote the new product on their respective 
                                    social media platforms, from which they will be invited to an exclusive event(s). Yelp currently uses a similar strategy to increase 
                                    engagement with writing reviews. </li>
